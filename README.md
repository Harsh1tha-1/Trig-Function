# Trig-Function
About This project was done during my internship at SkillBot. In this internship, each student had to pick one VLSI IP and work on ASIC Design Flow. I chose "Trigonometric Functions in Double Floating Point Unit" as the IP for my project. We were asked to complete our project up until the PnR Stage ( Placement and Route ).
